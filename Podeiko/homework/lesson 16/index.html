                        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                            React
                            and
                            the app platform‚Äôs
                            native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
                            well
                            as to
                            describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <i>bundles of
                                reusable, nestable code</i>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
                            first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                        <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user
                            interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React
                            itself. This section can get you started or can serve
                            as a refresher course.
                        </p>
                        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                        <p> <strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                            examples:
                            friendly,
                            approachable creatures that
                            need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                        <p> <strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                            elements
                            inside JavaScript like
                            so: <code>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I
                        am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</code>. </p>
                        <p>The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more.
                            Because JSX is
                            JavaScript, you can
                            use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span>name</span> for the cat, name, and
                            embedding
                            it with
                            curly braces inside <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code>
                        </p>
                        <p> <strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
                        <p> <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
                            components render, state
                            is like a
                            component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
                            or
                            that
                            comes from user
                            interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                        <h2>Handling text input <sup>Chapter 4</sup> </h2>
                        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                            <i>onChangeText</i>
                            prop that takes a function to
                            be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
                            be
                            called when the text is
                            submitted.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                            different
                            language. In this new
                            language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob"
                            would
                            be
                            translated as "üçï
                            üçï".</p>
