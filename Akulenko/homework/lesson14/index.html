                <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! 
                If you're looking for environment setup instructions, they've
                moved to <u>their own section.</u> Continue reading for an introduction

            <p>React Native is an open source framework for building 
                Android and iOS applications using React and the app 
                platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use 
                JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to 
                describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using 
                React components: <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code.</i>  
                You can learn more about React in the next section. 
                But first, nlet‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

            <h1>REACT FUNDAMENTALS<sup>Chapter 3</sup></h1>    
        <div>
            <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. 
                To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. 
                This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p><b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: 
                friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>  
            <p><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript 
                like so: <span class="dada"><span class="cat">&#60;</span>Text<span class="cat">&#62;</span> Hello, I am your cat!
                <span class="cat">&#60;</span><span class="cat">&#8260;</span>Text<span class="cat">&#62;</span>.</span>
            </p>
            <p>The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. 
                Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. 
                Here you are declaring a <span class="dada">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces 
                inside <span class="dada"><span class="cat">&#60;</span>Text<span class="cat">&#62;</span></span>
            </p>
            <p><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. 
            </p>
            <p><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a 
                component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or 
                that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

        <h1>HANDILNK TEXT INPUT<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h1>    
    <div>
        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <i>onChangeText</i> 
            prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, 
            and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words 
            into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: 
            üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
