                   If you're looking for environment setup instructions, they've

                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android
                    and iOS applications using React and the app platform&#39;s native
                    capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                    platform&#39;s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
                    of your UI using React components: <span class="italics">bundles of reusable,
                    nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section.
                    But first, let&#39;s cover how components work in React Native.

                <p class="text-margins">React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open
                    source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the
                    most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
                    get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                </p>
                <p class="text-margins">We&#39;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                <p class="text-margins"><span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
                    in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                </p>
                <p class="text-margins"><span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                    elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="background-color">&#60;Text&#62;Hello, I am your cat! &#60;/Text&#62;</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-margins">The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you
                    can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you
                    are declaring a <span class="background-color">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly
                    braces inside <span class="background-color">&#60;Text&#62;</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-margins"><span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                </p>
                <p><span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as
                    arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a component&#39;s personal
                    data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user
                    interaction. State gives your components memory!

                <div class="title">
                    <h2>Handling Text Input</h2><span class="superscript">Chapter 4</span>
                </div>
                <p class="text-margins">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to
                    enter text. It has an <span class="italics">onChangeText</span> prop that
                    takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing
                    prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                </p>
                <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into
                    a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way:
                    üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
