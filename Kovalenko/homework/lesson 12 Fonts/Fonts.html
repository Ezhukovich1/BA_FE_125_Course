        <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup <br>
            instructions, they've moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
            <br> documentation, Native Components, React, and more!

        <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and <br> the
            app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs <br> APIs
            as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span2>bundles <br>
                of reusable, nestable code.</span2> You can learn more about React in the next section. But first,
            let‚Äôs cover <br> how components work in React Native.</p>

        <p>React Native runs on <u>React,</u> a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
            <br> JavaScript. To
            make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get <br> you started or
            can
            serve as a refresher course.
        </p>
        <div class="spacing40px"></div>
        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <div class="spacing40px"></div>
        <p>
            <span3>+ components.</span3> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
            approachable
            creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
        </p>
        <div class="spacing40px"></div>
        <p>
            <span3>+ JSX.</span3> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside
            JavaScript like so: <br>
            <span4>&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat! /&lt;Text&gt;</span4>.
        </p>
        <div class="spacing40px"></div>
        <p>The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
            you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, and embedding it with
            curly
            braces inside <span4>&lt;Text&gt;</span4>
        </p>
        <div class="spacing40px"></div>
        <p>
            <span3>+ props.</span3> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
        </p>
        <div class="spacing40px"></div>
        <p>
            <span3>+ state.</span3> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
            render, <br> state is like
            a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over <br> time or that
            comes
            from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
        </p>

    <section class="chapter1">
        <div class="text-chapt">
            <h1>handling text input</h1>
            <p2>Chapter4</p2>
        </div>
        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span2>onChangeText</span2> prop
            that <br> takes a
            function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a <br> function to
            be
            called when the text is submitted.</p>
        <div class="spacing40px"></div>
        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. <br>
            In this new language, every single word is written the same way:üçï. So the sentence "Hello there <br> Bob"
            would
            be translated as "üçï üçï".
